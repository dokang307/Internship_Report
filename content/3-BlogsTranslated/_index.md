### [Blog 1 - Optimizing SAP Operations with CloudWatch MCP server and Amazon Q CLI – Part 3](3.1-Blog1/)

Here is the summary in English:

This blog introduces a solution for optimizing SAP operations on AWS by integrating **Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server** and **Amazon Q CLI**, effectively addressing challenges such as complex command syntax and manual troubleshooting. By enabling engineers to interact with the system using natural language, Amazon Q CLI automatically translates requests into precise technical commands, while the CloudWatch MCP Server provides real-time data context (metrics and logs) to execute complex tasks like automated health reporting and routine maintenance. This powerful combination not only simplifies monitoring and accelerates incident resolution in alignment with the AWS Well-Architected Framework but also significantly boosts operational productivity for SAP administration teams.

### [Blog 2 - Streamlining SAP Operations with CloudWatch MCP Server and Amazon Q CLI – Part 4](3.2-Blog2/)

This article, the fourth installment in the series on optimizing SAP operations, focuses on the advanced application of Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server and Amazon Q CLI to streamline planned maintenance and accelerate Root-Cause Analysis (RCA). Through practical scenarios—such as coordinating cluster maintenance and resolving complex ERS service failures caused by configuration errors—the post demonstrates how this integration enables engineers to diagnose issues, propose solutions, and execute precise remediation commands using natural language without the need for context switching. By unifying observability data from both SAP and AWS to minimize Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR), the solution not only bridges the knowledge gap between SAP Basis and infrastructure teams but also significantly enhances operational productivity and system reliability at a reasonable implementation cost.

### [Blog 3 - Deploy Okta as a Custom Identity Provider for AWS Transfer Family](3.3-Blog3/)

Here is the summary in English:

This blog details the implementation of Okta as a Custom Identity Provider (IdP) for AWS Transfer Family to address the challenges of managing granular data access and security in growing organizations. Utilizing a modular architecture powered by Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda, the solution enables robust Okta authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support while offering precise control over individual user sessions, including specific home directory mappings and IAM roles. Through a step-by-step walkthrough covering Okta configuration, AWS toolkit deployment, and connection testing, the post provides a standardized, scalable framework for building secure SFTP environments that integrate seamlessly with centralized identity management systems.
