Following previous discussions on SAP observability (Part 1) and Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights features (Part 2), this third article introduces a powerful combination of tools that is changing how teams manage SAP systems: Amazon CloudWatch Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server and Amazon Q for command line (Q CLI).\nThis innovative solution addresses three major challenges in SAP operations:\nComplex command syntax slowing down operational progress Time-consuming root cause analysis requiring multiple tools and contexts The need for lean system health monitoring and reporting In this blog, we will:\nExplore how CloudWatch MCP Server and Q CLI collaborate to simplify SAP operations Present real-world use cases for creating automated system health reports Illustrate how natural language commands can optimize routine maintenance tasks Demonstrate the alignment of this solution with the AWS Well-Architected Framework for SAP Part four of the series will focus on maintenance planning, advanced root cause analysis, and a detailed cost review when deploying this solution.\nFigure 1. Architecture diagram of Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server and Amazon Q for CLI\nWhat is Amazon Q for CLI (Q CLI)? Amazon Q CLI delivers transformative value to AWS customers by integrating an AI assistant directly into the command line workflow. It allows users to express commands in natural language, which Q then translates into standard CLI syntax, significantly shortening the learning curve. The tool provides contextual command suggestions based on user intent, eliminating time-consuming documentation searches. When errors occur, Q provides clear explanations and troubleshooting steps, accelerating the resolution process.\nQ decomposes commands into easy-to-understand components, enhancing comprehension and skills. By keeping users within the terminal environment, Q optimizes workflows by eliminating interruptions caused by switching to external resources.\nThis productivity improvement helps reduce time spent searching for syntax examples and troubleshooting, allowing developers to focus on building rather than wrestling with command structures. Q\u0026rsquo;s interactivity accelerates learning, helping users master the AWS CLI faster. Ultimately, Amazon Q CLI transforms the command line experience from a potential barrier into an intuitive interface, making AWS services more accessible and efficient for customers of all expertise levels.\nFigure 2. Amazon Q CLI prompt interface\nWhat is Amazon CloudWatch Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server? The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard that revolutionizes how development tools communicate with AI models. By providing structured context about code, files, and projects, MCP enables AI assistants to provide precisely tailored recommendations. A practical application is the CloudWatch MCP Server, which integrates metrics and logs from CloudWatch directly into the development environment. As a result, developers can monitor and troubleshoot without leaving their IDE (Integrated Development Environment), optimizing operational workflows.\nThe AWS Labs CloudWatch MCP Server bridges the gap between AI troubleshooting agents and operational data. It enables AI-driven root cause analysis and recommendations, using CloudWatch remotely without needing custom API integrations.\nThe Server features 4 specialized tools:\nAlarm Based Troubleshooting: Identifies active alarms and analyzes historical patterns to find root causes, offering contextual remediation recommendations. Log Analyzer: Inspects CloudWatch log groups for anomalies and errors over specific time intervals. Metric Definition Analyzer: Provides descriptions of metrics, calculation methods, and recommended statistics. Alarm Recommendations: Suggests optimal alarm configurations with appropriate thresholds and evaluation periods. What are the tools in CloudWatch MCP Server? When a user enters a natural language prompt in Q CLI, a tool from the CloudWatch MCP Server is invoked to interact with AWS services to perform the task. You can start Q from the client by typing q and using /tools or /mcp to view the list of available tools and loaded MCP servers in the environment.\nFigure 3. Q CLI Server tools loaded in the client session\nFigure 4. CloudWatch MCP server loaded in the client session\nHow does this solution align with the Well-Architected Framework for SAP Lens? Lean SAP Operations: Q CLI improves SAP operational processes by allowing engineers to use natural language to execute AWS operations supporting SAP workloads. This aligns with the SAP Lens focus on automation and reducing manual effort in managing critical business systems, as CLI commands for SAP infrastructure can be generated through simple conversational requests. Accelerated SAP Troubleshooting: This combination reduces the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for SAP scenarios by providing contextual monitoring data and AI-assisted analysis of SAP components, thereby supporting rapid recovery from errors affecting business operations. Integrated Observability for SAP: The solution eliminates context switching by consolidating SAP-specific metrics, logs, and alarms directly into the client environment, supporting end-to-end monitoring across complex SAP systems. This integration helps teams observe SAP system behavior without workflow interruptions. SAP Change Impact Analysis: The tool helps teams understand how changes affect SAP system stability by providing immediate feedback on operational metrics across the entire SAP technology stack. SAP Resilience Verification: The tools simplify monitoring of SAP recovery mechanisms and fault isolation boundaries across distributed SAP systems, as well as testing the reliability of critical processes and transactions. Understanding SAP Architecture: Q CLI can explain relationships between AWS services and SAP applications based on CloudWatch data, giving your team additional perspective on SAP architectural reliability. Democratizing SAP Knowledge: The tool helps organizations \u0026ldquo;operate SAP as code.\u0026rdquo; Q CLI\u0026rsquo;s command-line explanation capabilities allow your team to operate efficiently on the SAP Landscape with sufficient information to make data-driven decisions. Prerequisites Deployment of an SAP S/4 HANA system with High Availability using AWS Launch Wizard for SAP Enablement of full-stack observability for SAP via Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for SAP Installation of Amazon Q CLI following steps in Installing Amazon Q for command line Configuration of CloudWatch MCP Server on your machine following instructions in the AWS Labs CloudWatch MCP repository Configuration of AWS CLI on your machine following instructions in configuration settings for the AWS CLI Access to the solution is secured by AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM); also review Q CLI Security considerations and best practices as well as Security best practices for Systems Manager. Apply the least-privilege access model for SAP Basis and AWS Infrastructure Engineers.\nUse-case 1: Create Health Reports for SAP This use case will create a health report for the SAP HANA database and the SAP Central Services (SAP ASCS) cluster. Q CLI generates contextual command-line commands to detect Amazon EC2 instances and build the health report. In this scenario, Q CLI runs multiple commands to check the status of SAP Central Services and generate a complete report:\nEnter prompt to generate the cluster health report. Run aws ec2 describe-instances for instances belonging to the cluster. Run ssm crm_mon command to check the status of nodes in the cluster. Run ssm command to check pacemaker.log.

The SAP HANA database, cluster infrastructure, and HANA System Replication (HSR) are all functioning properly after recovering from replication issues that occurred on July 11-12, 2025. ……\nConclusion The SAP HANA database, cluster infrastructure, and HSR are currently healthy and functioning as expected. The system has demonstrated resilience by recovering from previous replication issues. Regular monitoring and proactive maintenance are recommended to maintain system stability and performance.\nPrompt: What is the current status of SAP ASCS ERS cluster nodes for sap application SAPDemo.\nwhat is the current status of SAP ASCS ERS cluster nodes for sap application SAPDemo.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll check the current status of the SAP ASCS and ERS cluster nodes for the SAPDemo SAP application.\n🛠️ Using tool: executebash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ec2 describe-instances \u0026ndash;filters \u0026ldquo;Name=tag:Name,Values=_SAP-FIS-CS\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;query \u0026ldquo;Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==\u0026lsquo;Name\u0026rsquo;].Value|[0],State.Name,InstanceType,PrivateIpAddress]\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;output table ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Checking EC2 instances that are part of the SAP *SAPDemocluster\n| DescribeInstances | +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;+ | i-064751ba1b4c8340f | SAP-FIS-CS-sapclnode2 | running | c5a.xlarge | 10.0.155.180 | | i-0e08f883d5c3b3747 | SAP-FIS-CS-sapclnode1 | running | c5a.xlarge | 10.0.134.80 | +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;+\n⋮ ● Completed in 1.737s\n……\nConclusion The SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the *SAPDemo application is functioning properly with the expected resource distribution: • ASCS (Central Services) is active on sapclnode2 • ERS (Enqueue Replication Server) is active on sapclnode1 • Both nodes are online and healthy • The cluster has quorum and is properly configured for high availability\nThis is the expected configuration for an SAP high-availability setup, where ASCS and ERS run on separate nodes to ensure enqueue replication functionality in case of a node failure. The cluster is operating normally and no immediate action is required.\nFor complex operations, Q CLI guides multi-step processes while MCP provides real-time feedback on system status.\nUse-case 2: Simplify SAP Operations The following use case aims to maintain SAP Application Servers. Q CLI streamlines daily SAP management by creating runbooks for routine maintenance tasks. SAP BASIS administrators can use Q CLI to manage administrative tasks while monitoring real-time system status via the CloudWatch MCP server during maintenance windows. In this scenario, Q CLI creates a task list as follows:\nPrompt to check App Server status. Run aws ec2 describe-instances to check the SAP application server. Run ssm ps command to check SAP dispatcher and dialog processes. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get system status. Summarize that the SAP application server is stopped. Prompt to start the SAP application server. Run ssm sapcontrol command to start the SAP application server. Run ssm sapcontrol command to check the status of processes. Run ssm ps command to check SAP dialog processes. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get system status. Summarize that the SAP application server has been started. Important Note: The prompts and responses below have been abbreviated. You can download Use-case 2 - Simplify SAP Operations to view the full prompt and response from Q CLI.\nPrompt: Get status of sap in application server sapbaseaas1. Do not start the server, only report on current status of SAP process.\nget status of sap in application server sapbaseaas1. Do not start the server, Only report on current status of SAP process.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll check the current status of SAP processes on the application server sapbaseaas1 without starting the server. 🛠️ Using tool: executebash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ec2 describe-instances \u0026ndash;filters \u0026ldquo;Name=tag:Name,Values=_sapbaseaas1\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;query \u0026ldquo;Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==\u0026lsquo;Name\u0026rsquo;].Value|[0],State.Name,PrivateIpAddress]\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;output table ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Finding the instance ID for sapbaseaas1 ..\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ll check the current status of the SAP processes on the running sapbaseaas1 server: ……..\nConclusion The SAP application server sapbaseaas1 is currently stopped. While the EC2 instance itself is running and the SAP support processes are active, the actual SAP application instance (dialog instance) is not running. No work processes are active, and the instance is showing as GRAY in the system status. The instance would need to be started to become operational and process SAP transactions.\nIn the next scenario, the SAP BASIS administrator will ask Amazon Q from the CLI to start an SAP application server, the associated SAP service, and report on the SAP application status. Q CLI\u0026rsquo;s execute_bash tool runs 8 SSM commands to execute the request.\nPrompt: Start SAP on the SAP application server sapbaseaas1.\nstart SAP on the SAP application server sapbaseaas1\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start the SAP application on the sapbaseaas1 server.\n🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ssm send-command \u0026ndash;instance-ids i-0539ecbaf407c4886 \u0026ndash;document-name \u0026ldquo;AWS-RunShellScript\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;parameters \u0026lsquo;commands=[\u0026ldquo;sudo su - ecdadm -c \u0026quot;sapcontrol -nr 00 -function Start\u0026quot;\u0026rdquo;]\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;output json ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Starting SAP instance on sapbaseaas1\n..\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s check if the SAP instance has started successfully:\n……..\nConclusion The SAP application server sapbaseaas1 is now fully operational. All required processes are running, and the instance is properly integrated with the SAP system. The instance is ready to handle user workloads and process SAP transactions.\nConclusion CloudWatch MCP Server delivers unified observability across the entire SAP landscape within the client environment. It consolidates SAP application logs, SAP HANA metrics, and AWS EC2 performance data. The system automatically correlates metrics across SAP components. Q CLI complements this by enabling natural language interaction with this rich dataset, making it easy for teams to generate system logs and simplify SAP system operations. This solution aligns with AWS Well-Architected Frameworks to help you increase productivity in operating and maintaining your SAP Landscape.\nIn future blog posts, we will discuss how you can leverage CloudWatch MCP Server and Q CLI for maintenance planning and accelerating root cause analysis for SAP, as well as diving into the cost considerations of the solution.\nAs a next step, try out this solution — you can achieve at least a 6x gain in productivity.

Continuing our previous discussions on Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights in Part 1, how we used CloudWatch Application Insights to monitor SAP High Availability in Part 2, and Amazon CloudWatch Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server combined with Amazon Q for command line (Q CLI) in Part 3, this fourth article illustrates advanced real-world applications of these tools.\nWe will explore how this integration streamlines SAP maintenance planning and accelerates root cause analysis through practical use cases.\nThrough detailed examples, we will demonstrate how CloudWatch MCP Server and Q CLI work together to:\nOrchestrate planned maintenance events with minimal disruption. Accelerate issue diagnosis through intelligent log analysis. Provide context-aware recommendations for SAP operations. Reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for SAP incidents. Use-case 3: Planned Maintenance Events for SAP In this case, we will execute a planned maintenance event within an SAP application cluster. Workflow integration allows engineering teams to diagnose issues without disruptive context switching, by viewing CloudWatch metrics directly within the IDE while using Q CLI to generate precise remediation commands.\nIn this scenario, Q CLI generated the following task list:\nPrompt to check the status of the App Server. Run aws ec2 describe-instances to check the SAP cluster status. Run ssm crm_mon command to check the ASCS and ERS cluster. Run ssm ps command to get the process status of ASCS and ERS. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get the process list. Run ssm command to check pacemaker.log. Run ssm crm command to check cluster resource status, constraints, and configuration. Summarize that ERS is disabled due to cluster misconfiguration. After prompt to check CloudWatch logs: Run describe_log_groups. Run analyze_log_groups. Run search execute_log_insights_query related to ASCS and ERS. Run search execute_log_insights_query related to current ERS issues. Summarize all log entries related to the ERS issue. After prompt to start the SAP ERS service: Run ssm crm command to check cluster resource status. Run ssm crm command to enable the ERS resource (failed as expected). Run ssm command to update resource configuration. Run ssm crm command to re-enable the ERS resource (after fixing configuration). Run ssm sapcontrol command to get the ASCS and ERS process list. Summarize that the ERS service has been started successfully. Important Note: The prompts and responses below have been abbreviated. You can download the Use-case 3 – Planned maintenance events for SAP document to view the full prompts and responses from Q CLI.\nPrompt: Check the status of the SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the SAPDemo SAP application without restarting any services.\n\u0026gt; I\u0026#39;ll check the status of the SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the SAPDemo SAP application without restarting any services. 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ec2 describe-instances --filters \u0026#34;Name=tag:Name,Values=*SAP-FIS-CS*\u0026#34; --query \u0026#34;Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;].Value|[0],State.Name,InstanceType,PrivateIpAddress]\u0026#34; --output table ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Checking EC2 instances that are part of the SAP cluster ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | DescribeInstances | +----------------------+-------------------------+----------+-------------+---------------+ | i-064751ba1b4c8340f | SAP-FIS-CS-sapclnode2 | running | c5a.xlarge | 10.0.155.180 | | i-0e08f883d5c3b3747 | SAP-FIS-CS-sapclnode1 | running | c5a.xlarge | 10.0.134.80 | +----------------------+-------------------------+----------+-------------+---------------+ ⋮ ● Completed in 1.666s …… ## Conclusion The SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the SAPDemo application is partially operational: • The ASCS instance is running correctly on sapclnode2 • The ERS instance is intentionally disabled (target-role=Stopped in the configuration) • The virtual IP for ERS is still active on sapclnode1 • Both cluster nodes are online and the cluster has quorum This configuration appears to be intentional based on the cluster configuration, but it means that enqueue replication is not currently active. In a normal high-availability setup, both ASCS and ERS would be running to ensure enqueue table replication in case of a failover. In this next scenario, we use CloudWatch MCP Server to investigate pacemaker cluster logs to determine the status of SAP ASCS. CloudWatch MCP Server invokes tools such as describe_log_groups, analyze_log_groups, and execute_log_insights_query to perform the analysis.\nPrompt: Check CloudWatch logs related to SAPDemo application for SAP ASCS ERS Pacemaker cluster events, alarms and issues.\n\u0026gt; Check CloudWatch logs related to SAPDemo application for SAP ASCS ERS Pacemaker cluster events, alarms and issues. only use cloudwatch mcp server for this analysis. \u0026gt; I\u0026#39;ll analyze the CloudWatch logs related to the SAPDemo application for SAP ASCS ERS Pacemaker cluster events, alarms, and issues using only the CloudWatch MCP server. Let\u0026#39;s start by identifying the relevant log groups for the SAPDemo application: 🛠️ Using tool: describe_log_groups (trusted) from mcp server awslabscloudwatch_mcp_server ⋮ ● Running describe_log_groups with the param: ⋮ { ⋮ \u0026#34;arguments\u0026#34;: { ⋮ \u0026#34;log_group_name_prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PACEMAKER\u0026#34;, ⋮ \u0026#34;region\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;us-east-1\u0026#34; ⋮ }, ⋮ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;describe_log_groups\u0026#34; ⋮ } ⋮ ● Completed in 0.760s …… ### Analysis: This log data shows that the ERS component (rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11) has been successfully started on sapclnode1. The cluster first cleared previous failure records, then migrated the IP resource (rsc_ip_ECD_ERS11) from node 2 to node 1, and finally started the ERS service on node 1. The successful start is confirmed by the @rc-code=0 in the logs, indicating no errors. The monitoring operation is also successful, showing that the service is running properly. This aligns with our previous findings where we had identified issues with the ERS component and cleared CloudWatch alarms for it. The logs now confirm that the ERS service has been successfully started and is being monitored by the cluster, which explains why the service is now running despite previous alarms. Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of these logs in more detail or provide recommendations for ongoing monitoring of the ERS component? Prompt: start SAP ERS service on node sapclnode1.\n\u0026gt; start SAP ERS services on node sapclnode1 \u0026gt; I\u0026#39;ll start the SAP ERS services on node sapclnode1. 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0e08f883d5c3b3747 --document-name \u0026#34;AWS-RunShellScript\u0026#34; --parameters \u0026#39;commands=[\u0026#34;sudo crm resource status rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; --output json ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Checking the current status of the ERS resource .. …… ## Conclusion The SAP ERS services have been successfully started on node sapclnode1. The enqueue replication is now active and functioning correctly, providing high availability for the SAP enqueue service. The cluster is now in a fully operational state with all resources running as expected. Use-case 4: Accelerate Root-Cause Analysis for SAP In this scenario, we have an SAP cluster where ERS encountered an error due to misconfiguration. With the integration between Q CLI and CloudWatch MCP Server, traditional diagnostic challenges in complex SAP systems – where issues often propagate through multiple system layers – are eliminated. Q CLI generated the following task list:\nPrompt to check the status of the App Server. Run aws ec2 describe-instances to check the SAP cluster status. Run ssm crm_mon command to check the ASCS and ERS cluster. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get the process list on node 1 and node 2. Run ssm crm command to check cluster resource status and logs. Run ssm command to check pacemaker.log. Run ssm crm command to cleanup resources. Run ssm crm_mon command to check cluster status. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get the process list on node 2. Summarize that the analysis results indicate the issue stems from a configuration problem. After \u0026ldquo;Prompt to troubleshoot this problem\u0026rdquo;: Run ssm command to check SAP System Logs for ASCS and ERS on node 2. Run ssm command to check SAP profiles of ASCS and ERS. Run ssm command to check hostname configuration in hosts file on node 2. Run ssm command to check IP addresses of node 1 and node 2. Run ssm command to update hosts file on node 1 and node 2. Run ssm crm_mon command to cleanup resources. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get the process list on node 2. Run ssm sapcontrol command to start ERS service, then check logs. Run ssm sapcontrol command to start ASCS, then check logs. Run ssm crm_mon command to stop cluster, then check status. Run ssm crm_mon command to cleanup cluster resources. Run ssm crm_mon command to start cluster, wait and check. Run ssm sapcontrol command to get ASCS process list on node 1. Run ssm sapcontrol command to start ASCS service, then check. Summarize recommendations to fix the issue. After \u0026ldquo;Prompt to start the SAP ERS service\u0026rdquo;: Run ssm crm command to stop ASCS and ERS cluster resources. Run ssm command to verify and update hosts file on node 1 and node 2. Run ssm command to check hostname resolution on node 1 and node 2 (first update failed, but retried with a different method). Run ssm command to check SAP Profiles of ASCS and ERS. Run ssm crm_mon command to cleanup cluster resources. Run ssm sapcontrol command to start SAP ASCS and ERS resources, then verify.

The services may be failing to start due to configuration issues, file system problems, or other SAP-specific issues that need to be investigated further. Prompt: Help me troubleshoot this problem.\n\u0026gt; help me troubleshoot this problem \u0026gt; I\u0026#39;ll help you troubleshoot the issues with the SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the SAPDemo application. Based on the current state, both the ASCS and ERS services are failing to start properly, even though the cluster infrastructure itself is functioning correctly. Let\u0026#39;s take a systematic approach to troubleshooting: ## Step 1: Check SAP-specific error logs First, let\u0026#39;s check the SAP system logs to understand why the services are failing to start: 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-064751ba1b4c8340f --document-name \u0026#34;AWS-RunShellScript\u0026#34; --parameters \u0026#39;commands=[\u0026#34;sudo su - ecdadm -c \\\u0026#34;tail -50 /usr/sap/ECD/ASCS10/work/dev_ms\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; --output json ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Checking SAP system logs for ASCS on node 2 .. \u0026gt; Now let\u0026#39;s check the ERS logs: …….. \u0026gt; Based on my troubleshooting, I\u0026#39;ve identified the root cause of the issues with your SAP ASCS/ERS cluster and can provide you with a comprehensive solution: # SAP ASCS/ERS Cluster Troubleshooting Report ## Root Cause Analysis After thorough investigation, I\u0026#39;ve identified that the primary issue is related to hostname resolution. The error message MsSInit: NihostToAddr rc=(NIEHOST_UNKNOWN) in the ASCS logs clearly indicates that the Message Server cannot resolve its hostname. ### Specific Issues Identified: 1. Hostname Resolution Problems: • The SAP profiles are configured to use the hostnames ecdascsnode and ecdersnode, but these hostnames were not properly defined in the /etc/hosts files on both nodes. • We\u0026#39;ve updated the hosts files, but the SAP services are still failing to start properly. 2. IP Address Configuration: • The virtual IPs (192.168.48.201 for ASCS and 192.168.48.202 for ERS) are not being properly managed by the cluster. • Both virtual IPs are currently assigned to node 1 (sapclnode1), which is causing conflicts. 3. SAP Profile Configuration: • The SAP profiles are using hostnames that don\u0026#39;t match the actual hostnames of the cluster nodes. • The ERS service is trying to connect to the ASCS service but failing with \u0026#34;Connection refused\u0026#34; errors. ## Solution Steps To fully resolve these issues, we need to take the following steps: ### 1. Fix the Hostname Resolution We\u0026#39;ve already updated the /etc/hosts files on both nodes with the correct mappings, but we need to ensure that the SAP services can properly resolve the hostnames. ### 2. Update the SAP Profiles The SAP profiles need to be updated to use the correct hostnames or IP addresses. This is a more involved task that requires careful editing of the SAP profiles. ### 3. Restart the Cluster Services in the Correct Order The cluster services need to be restarted in the correct order to ensure proper operation: 1. Stop all SAP services 2. Stop the cluster 3. Fix the configuration 4. Start the cluster 5. Start the SAP services ### 4. Verify DNS Resolution We need to ensure that DNS resolution is working correctly on both nodes. ## Recommended Actions Here\u0026#39;s a step-by-step plan to resolve the issues: 1. Stop the cluster resources: bash sudo crm resource stop rsc_sap_ECD_ASCS10 sudo crm resource stop rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11 2. Verify the hosts file configuration on both nodes: bash cat /etc/hosts Ensure that both nodes have the following entries: 127.0.0.1 localhost 10.0.134.80 sapclnode1.ec2.internal sapclnode1 10.0.155.180 sapclnode2.ec2.internal sapclnode2 192.168.48.201 ecdascsnode 192.168.48.202 ecdersnode 3. Test hostname resolution: bash ping -c 3 ecdascsnode ping -c 3 ecdersnode ping -c 3 sapclnode1 ping -c 3 sapclnode2 4. Update the SAP profiles if necessary: • Review the SAP profiles to ensure they\u0026#39;re using the correct hostnames • Consider updating the profiles to use IP addresses instead of hostnames if resolution continues to be an issue 5. Clean up the cluster resources: bash sudo crm resource cleanup rsc_sap_ECD_ASCS10 sudo crm resource cleanup rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11 6. Start the resources in the correct order: bash sudo crm resource start rsc_sap_ECD_ASCS10 # Wait for ASCS to fully start sudo crm resource start rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11 7. Verify the SAP services are running: bash sudo su - ecdadm -c \u0026#34;sapcontrol -nr 10 -function GetProcessList\u0026#34; sudo su - ecdadm -c \u0026#34;sapcontrol -nr 11 -function GetProcessList\u0026#34; ## Long-term Recommendations 1. Implement DNS Resolution: Consider implementing proper DNS resolution instead of relying on /etc/hosts files. 2. Review Cluster Configuration: Review the cluster configuration to ensure it\u0026#39;s properly set up for SAP ASCS/ERS high availability. 3. Monitor the Cluster: Set up proper monitoring for the cluster to detect and alert on issues. 4. Document the Configuration: Document the cluster configuration and troubleshooting steps for future reference. 5. Regular Testing: Regularly test failover scenarios to ensure the cluster is working correctly. By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues with your SAP ASCS/ERS cluster and ensure it\u0026#39;s properly configured for high availability. Prompt: Apply the above solution to fix the problem.\n\u0026gt; apply the above solution to fix the problem \u0026gt; I\u0026#39;ll apply the solution to fix the SAP ASCS/ERS cluster issues. Let\u0026#39;s follow the step-by-step plan: ## Step 1: Stop the cluster resources \u0026gt; I need to use SSM to execute these commands on the cluster nodes: 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ⋮ ● I will run the following shell command: aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0e08f883d5c3b3747 --document-name \u0026#34;AWS-RunShellScript\u0026#34; --parameters \u0026#39;commands=[\u0026#34;sudo crm resource stop rsc_sap_ECD_ASCS10 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo crm resource stop rsc_sap_ECD_ERS11\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; --output json ⋮ ↳ Purpose: Stopping the cluster resources using SSM .. \u0026gt; ## Step 2: Verify the hosts file configuration on both nodes …… \u0026gt; Great! The solution has been successfully applied and the SAP ASCS/ERS cluster is now working correctly. Here\u0026#39;s a summary of what we did: ## Summary of the Fix 1. Fixed Hostname Resolution: • Updated the /etc/hosts files on both nodes with the correct mappings for all hostnames. • Verified that hostname resolution was working correctly by pinging the virtual hostnames. 2. Cleaned Up and Restarted Cluster Resources: • Stopped the cluster resources to ensure a clean state. • Cleaned up any failed resource actions. • Started the resources in the correct order: ASCS first, then ERS. 3. Verified the Services: • Confirmed that both the ASCS and ERS services are now running correctly. • The system instance list shows all components are GREEN (running). ## Current Status • **Cluster Status**: All resources are running correctly. • **ASCS Status**: The Message Server and Enqueue Server are both running on node 2 (sapclnode2). • **ERS Status**: The Enqueue Replication Server is running on node 1 (sapclnode1). • **Virtual IPs**: The virtual IPs are correctly assigned to the appropriate nodes. ## Recommendations for Long-term Stability 1. Regular Monitoring: Set up monitoring for the cluster to detect any issues early. 2. Failover Testing: Regularly test failover scenarios to ensure the cluster works correctly. 3. Documentation: Document the cluster configuration and troubleshooting steps for future reference. 4. DNS Resolution: Consider implementing proper DNS resolution instead of relying on /etc/hosts files. The SAP ASCS/ERS cluster for the SAPDemo application is now functioning correctly. The issue was primarily related to hostname resolution, which we\u0026#39;ve fixed by properly configuring the hosts files on both nodes. [Figure 6. Final healthy status of SAP Central Services (ASCS/ERS) cluster]\nCost Considerations To deploy this solution, you need to consider the following factors:\nAmazon Q CLI Cost is shown in [this link]. We recommend using at least the Pro tier with 1,000 agentic requests per month ($19/month/user). Amazon CloudWatch Cost is shown in [this link]. In this experiment, we assume that the Free tier is sufficient. AWS Systems Manager Cost is shown in [this link]. For the HA experiment, assuming there are a minimum of 6 nodes to manage: $0.01137 \\text{ USD} \\times 6 \\text{ nodes} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 3.27456 \\text{ USD}$ No additional cost when using Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server. Estimated HA setup cost for SAP NetWeaver (calculated in us-east-1 region): 2 × m5.large = 148.16 USD (ASCS and ERS) 2 × m5.xlarge = 280.32 USD (2 App Servers) 2 × r5.2xlarge = 756.32 USD (SAP HANA Primary and Secondary) Total Estimated Cost = 19 USD + 3.27456 USD + 39.4933 USD ≈ 61.76786 USD for a one-day experiment.\nConclusion CloudWatch MCP Server delivers unified observability across the entire SAP landscape within the customer environment. It consolidates SAP application logs, SAP HANA metrics, and AWS EC2 performance data. The system automatically correlates metrics across SAP components. Q CLI complements this capability by enabling natural language interaction with this rich dataset, allowing teams to easily investigate session response times, compare HANA memory consumption patterns, or identify waiting SAP processes during performance incidents.\nCloudWatch MCP Server helps troubleshoot complex SAP issues by identifying anomalies through pattern analysis in system logs and transaction errors. It links infrastructure alarms to application behavior. Additionally, it provides historical context from similar past incidents. Q CLI enhances this capability by interpreting SAP error codes, generating diagnostic commands based on observed patterns, suggesting root causes, and recommending relevant SAP transaction codes for deeper investigation.\nThis integration bridges the knowledge gap between SAP BASIS administrators and AWS infrastructure teams by creating a shared operational view of the SAP system and translating between SAP terminology and AWS concepts. This combination reduces mean time to resolution by eliminating context switching, providing intelligent analysis of SAP-specific patterns, and enabling natural language interaction with monitoring data — leading to faster troubleshooting, higher reliability, and more efficient operations for critical SAP workloads on AWS.\nAs a next step, try applying this solution; you can achieve at least a 6x gain in productivity. Stay tuned for upcoming innovations regarding Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Model Context Protocol Servers, and Amazon Q for command line.\nJoin the SAP on AWS Discussion In addition to your customer account team and AWS Support channels, we recently launched re:Post – A reimagined Q\u0026amp;A experience for the AWS community.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nDeploy Okta as a Custom Identity Provider for AWS Transfer Family By: Yongki Kim and Tamelly Lim Date: AUGUST 11, 2025 Categories: AWS Transfer Family, Storage, Technical How-to, Permalink | Comments | Share\nAs projects and the number of users within an organization grow, managing granular access to data resources while adhering to security regulations becomes critically important. Multi-user environments require appropriate access delegation to ensure data privacy and security.\nHowever, managing access to shared files can be complex and time-consuming, especially as the user base expands and is distributed across multiple identity providers. Organizations need a scalable solution to enforce granular access controls, define which users can access sensitive data, and ensure appropriate access levels for shared files — thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nAWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables you to transfer files into and out of AWS storage services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS without managing any SFTP servers. The service also supports integration with identity providers like Okta, enabling end-user management for file exchange through an AWS managed SFTP server.\nIn a previous post on the Storage blog, we introduced the AWS Transfer Family Custom IdP solution, aimed at providing reusable components and examples to simplify setting up Transfer Family for common scenarios, as well as how to use it with Microsoft Active Directory authentication.\nIn this post, we will guide you through deploying a custom Identity Provider (IdP) solution with Okta, allowing organizations to use Okta authentication for their Transfer Family servers. You can leverage built-in features of the Custom IdP solution, such as per-user permissions.\nSolution Architecture The proposed architecture provides a reusable foundation and demonstrates best practices for deploying a custom IdP while allowing granular control over session configuration on a per-user basis, as illustrated in the following figure. This modular architecture promotes code reusability, ease of maintenance, and scalability. This makes it easy to adapt to changing requirements or integrate with other systems.\nBy default, this architecture provides the following features:\nA standard schema in Amazon DynamoDB to store metadata about identity providers, related settings, user credentials, and user session configurations such as HomeDirectoryDetails, Role, and Policy. Support for multiple IdPs connecting to a single Transfer Family server. Support for multiple Transfer Family servers using the same deployment of this solution. Support for the following identity providers: Okta, LDAP (including Microsoft Active Directory), Entra ID, Argon2, Cognito, Public and Private Key, and AWS Secrets Manager. Per-user IP allow-listing. Standardized best-practice logging patterns, with configurable log levels and tracing support. Capability to deploy Amazon API Gateway for advanced use cases. Figure 1: Custom Identity Provider Solution Architecture\nIn this example, we will walk through the steps to deploy and configure Okta as a custom IdP for AWS Transfer Family.\nPrerequisites The following prerequisites are required to deploy this solution:\nAn AWS account with access to AWS CloudShell. Appropriate permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provision the following resource types: Create IAM roles Create DynamoDB tables Create AWS Lambda functions Create API Gateway (if enabled) An Okta organization. Deployment Guide In this solution, we illustrate a use case where an organization requires Okta authentication with TOTP (time-based one-time password) based MFA for their Transfer Family server. The organization needs the flexibility to assign each user a unique Transfer Family session configuration, such as Role, HomeDirectoryDetails, and PosixProfile.\nIn this walkthrough, we will cover the following steps:\nConfigure Okta: Create a new user and group in Okta Configure MFA Deploy the toolkit: Set up the custom IdP Provision all necessary resources for this solution Define the IdP and user: Configure IdP settings Manage user records in the IdP Test the IdP: Verify the functionality of the deployed solution 1. Configure Okta In this section, you will create a new user and group in your Okta organization and configure MFA.\nFigure 2: Okta Admin Console for Okta Identity Engine\nNote: These instructions apply specifically to Okta Identity Engine. If you are using Okta Classic, the interface and some settings will differ.\nLog in to your Okta organization as an administrator using the admin console (e.g., dev-xxxx-admin.okta.com/admin).\nFigure 3: Adding a user in Okta Admin Console\nNavigate to Directory in the sidebar, select People, and create an Okta user with the username john@demosftp.com. Set a desired password for this user.\nIn the same Directory tab, select Groups, click Add group, and create an Okta group named sftp.\nSelect the newly created group, then choose Assign people and add john@demosftp.com by selecting the plus sign (+) next to their name.\nFigure 4: Adding user to sftp group in Okta Admin Console\nNavigate to Security in the sidebar and select Authenticators. In the Setup tab, choose Add authenticator and add the TOTP authenticator used by your organization. Note: Only TOTP-based authenticators are supported with Transfer Family; push-based authenticators are not currently supported. In this case, you add Google Authenticator as an authenticator.\nTo enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Google Authenticator for SFTP users, navigate to the Enrollment tab and select Add a policy. Enter the following information:\nPolicy name: SFTP Users MFA Assign to groups: SFTP Authenticators: Switch Google Authenticator to Required. Select Create policy. In the appearing Add Rule dialog, set the Rule name to SFTP Users MFA Enrollment and select Create rule. To enforce MFA for user SFTP sessions, navigate to Security in the sidebar and go to Global Session Policy. Select Add policy and set the Policy name to sftp policy. In the Assign to groups section, add sftp, then select Create policy and Add rule.\nIn the appearing Add Rule dialog, set the Rule name to sftp rule. Set Multifactor authentication (MFA) to Required, then select Create rule.\nTo complete the Google Authenticator setup for the Okta user, log in to the Okta domain as john@demosftp.com. Open a private browsing window and navigate to your Okta organization URL (e.g., dev-xxxx.okta.com). At the login screen, enter john@demosftp.com and the password created in Step 1.2. When prompted, select Set up under Google Authenticator and follow the instructions to complete the setup. You only need to configure the Google Authenticator method. Once done, you can skip other MFA methods and select Continue to proceed with login.\nFigure 5: Setting up MFA for an Okta user\nNote: You have successfully added an Okta user to the newly created group and set up MFA for authentication. Before proceeding with the solution, the newly created Okta user must log in to the Okta domain to authenticate and set a new password.\n2. Deploy the Toolkit Log in to the AWS account where you want to deploy the solution, switch to the desired AWS Region to run Transfer Family, and launch a CloudShell session.\nRun the following command to clone the solution repository into your CloudShell environment:\ncd ~ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/toolkit-for-aws-transfer-family.git Run the following command to execute the build script, which downloads all dependencies and creates archives for the Lambda layer and function used in the solution:\ncd ~/toolkit-for-aws-transfer-family/solutions/custom-idp ./build.sh Monitor the execution process and verify that the script completes successfully.\nDeploy the stack using SAM:\nsam deploy --guided --template \\ ./examples/okta/transfer_okta_customIdp_server_template.yaml --\\ capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND\\ CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --disable-rollback When prompted, provide the following information as an example:\nStack Name: transferidp Parameter UserNameDelimiter: @@ Parameter LogLevel: INFO Parameter ProvisionApi: false Parameter EnableTracing: false Parameter UsersTableName: empty Parameter IdentityProvidersTableName: empty For other options, enter Y to keep the default values. Figure 7: Deploying AWS CloudFormation for custom IdP\nWhen the deployment completes successfully, copy/paste the AWS CloudFormation outputs from the deployed stack to a text editor and save them for later use.\nThe output information includes:\nDDBIdentityProvidersTableName: DynamoDB Identity Providers table name DDBUsersTableName: DynamoDB Users table name SFTPServerS3Bucket: S3 bucket name created as backend storage for the Transfer Family server TransferUserRole: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Role created to map to users TransferServerEndpoint: Endpoint of the Transfer Family server 3. Define the IdP Once the Transfer Family custom IdP solution is deployed, you need to define one or more IdPs in the DynamoDB identity_providers table. To use Okta as an IdP, you need to add Okta attributes to this table.\nTable name Comment [StackName]-CustomIdP-XXXX_identity_providers DynamoDB table containing details of each Transfer Family custom IdP (e.g., IdP name, server URL, parameters). [StackName]-CustomIdP-XXXX_users DynamoDB table containing details of each Transfer Family user (e.g., IdP used, IAM role, logical directory list). In the AWS Management Console, navigate to DynamoDB Item Explorer and select the identity_providers table from the table selection menu. Select Create item.\nFigure 8: DynamoDB table for custom IdP\nIn the Create item screen, select JSON view, then copy and paste the following record:\n{ \u0026#34;provider\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;okta\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;M\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;mfa\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;BOOL\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;okta_domain\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[OKTA DOMAIN]\u0026#34; } } }, \u0026#34;module\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;okta\u0026#34; } } Select the Form button to switch back to form view. Replace the placeholder value in the okta_domain field with your Okta organization domain (e.g., dev-xxxxx.okta.com).\nFigure 9: Creating IdP record in DynamoDB\nprovider: IdP name (e.g., okta). module: IdP module name to use (okta). config: Contains configuration details. mfa set to true means users must enter password + TOTP code. Select Create item.\n4. Define a User Next, you need to define a user and map that username to the newly created Okta IdP.\nIn the console, navigate to DynamoDB Item Explorer, select the users table (e.g., [StackName]-CustomIdP-XXXX_users). Select the Create item button.\nFigure 10: DynamoDB table for users\nIn the Create item screen, select JSON view, then copy and paste the following record:\n{ \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;john@demosftp.com\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;identity_provider_key\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;okta\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;M\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;HomeDirectoryDetails\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;L\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;M\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Entry\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/[SFTPServerS3Bucket]/${transfer:UserName}\u0026#34; } } } ] }, \u0026#34;HomeDirectoryType\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;LOGICAL\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Role\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[TransferUserRole]\u0026#34; } } } } Select the Form button. Expand the config section and replace [SFTPServerS3Bucket] and [TransferUserRole] with the corresponding CloudFormation output values from Step 2.5.\nFigure 11: Creating user record in DynamoDB\nSelect Create item.\n5. Test the IdP Navigate to the AWS Transfer Family console and select the deployed server.\nIn the top right corner, select Actions, then select Test from the dropdown menu.\nFigure 12: Testing SFTP access\nEnter john@demosftp.com in the username field. For the password field, enter your password concatenated with the TOTP code from Google Authenticator (Example: if your password is TestP@55w0rd and the MFA code is 201483, enter TestP@55w0rd201483). Source IP can be any value. Select Test.\nFigure 13: Testing authentication with MFA code\nIf successful, an HTTP 200 response will be returned. You can then connect to the Transfer Family server via an SFTP client using the TransferServerEndpoint from the CloudFormation output.\nFigure 14: Testing with SFTP command (note using \u0026ldquo;user@domain\u0026rdquo; format in quotes if needed)\nCleanup To delete the created resources:\nRun the command: sam delete --stack-name \u0026lt;stack-name\u0026gt; Manually delete the two DynamoDB tables (identity_providers and users) in the console. Manually delete the AWS Lambda Layer (handler-layer) in the console. Conclusion Standardizing deployment processes across multiple IdPs improves interoperability and enhances management efficiency. In this post, we guided you on how to deploy Okta as a custom IdP for AWS Transfer Family, integrating MFA for enhanced security. You can explore more about the solution and other modules (such as Active Directory, Entra ID, Cognito) in the GitHub toolkit repository.\nTAGS: AWS Storage Blog, AWS Transfer Family\nAbout the Authors:\nYongki Kim Yongki is an APJ Storage Specialist Solutions Architect with deep expertise in the comprehensive AWS storage portfolio.

Introduce DDD methods and event-driven architecture. Guide on selecting appropriate compute services. Introduce AI tools supporting the development lifecycle. List of Speakers Paul Haverfield - Principal Storage Specialist BDM, APJ Tamelly Lim - Specialist Solutions Architect Ameen Khan S - GTM specialist for Storage - Data \u0026amp; AI pillar covering ASEAN markets Paul Hidalgo - Key Highlights Today, I had the opportunity to attend an AWS program covering an extremely urgent topic in the current context: Data Resiliency. More than just simple backups, the event opened up new perspectives on protecting digital assets against increasingly sophisticated threats.\nHere are the key takeaways I gathered:\n1. Redefining: How is Data Resiliency different from High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR)? Previously, we often focused on HA (ensuring systems are always online) or DR (recovering from physical disasters). However, Data Resiliency is a broader and more \u0026ldquo;proactive\u0026rdquo; concept:\nContext: \u0026ldquo;Everything fails, all the time\u0026rdquo; (Werner Vogels) – Everything is prone to failure, including physical keys or hardware. The Difference: While HA handles infrastructure incidents, Data Resiliency focuses on data integrity. It is the organizational ability to maintain operations, withstand, and recover even when under cyberattack (such as Ransomware) or human error. Goal: To detect anomalies and automate response processes without human intervention. 2. Why has Data Resiliency become an \u0026ldquo;Absolute Necessity\u0026rdquo;? The explosion of data creation comes with new technological vulnerabilities. Three main trends are driving the shift from Protection to Resiliency:\nRegulatory: Compliance with strict data protection laws. Technology: The complexity of Multi-cloud and Hybrid-cloud environments. Threat Landscape: Ransomware no longer just encrypts primary data; it also targets backups. 3. Data Immutability: The Impenetrable Shield A keyword mentioned repeatedly was Data Immutability.\nThis refers to the ability to create data copies that cannot be changed or deleted for a set period. In the event of a Ransomware attack, even if hackers possess top-level admin rights, they cannot alter this backup. It acts as the \u0026ldquo;Last line of defense,\u0026rdquo; ensuring that at least one clean version always exists for recovery. 4. Protection Strategy: The AWS 3-2-1-1-0 Model The traditional 3-2-1 backup rule has been upgraded to suit the cloud era:\n3 copies of data. 2 different storage media. 1 off-site copy (different region). 1 offline or Immutable (Air-gapped) copy. 0 errors during recovery (verified by automated testing). Important concepts to remember:\nRPO (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss is acceptable? RTO (Recovery Time Objective): How long does it take to get the system running again? Backup Vault: A container for storing backups, encrypted by AWS KMS for enhanced security. 5. Tool Ecosystem \u0026amp; Solutions The event introduced powerful integrated solutions on AWS:\nCommvault Cloud on AWS: Provides Air Gap Protect (secure data isolation). Cloud Rewind: The ability to \u0026ldquo;rewind\u0026rdquo; time to restore entire instances or VPCs as if the incident never happened. Clumio: An all-in-one simplified backup solution. Uses Serverless Workflow architecture (an army of Lambda functions) to optimize costs and operations. Elastio: Focuses on: Detect, Respond, Recover. Scans for Malware/Ransomware directly within Snapshots to ensure backups do not contain latent malicious code. 6. Workshop Architecture: Real-world Implementation During the hands-on session, we deployed a comprehensive protection model:\nKey Components:\nSource: EC2 Instances (EBS) and S3 Buckets containing critical data. Mechanism: Using AWS Backup Plan with an hourly schedule. Protection Layers: Primary: Stored in a standard Vault (workshop-sources-regular-vault). Secondary (Air-gapped): Copied to another Region (us-east-1-LAG-Vault) with Immutability settings enabled. Validation: Integrated Elastio with AWS Backup. Automated Malware scanning on backups. Performed hourly Restore Testing to ensure backup viability (the \u0026ldquo;0 error\u0026rdquo; strategy). Conclusion The event shifted my mindset from merely \u0026ldquo;backing up data\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;building resiliency.\u0026rdquo; In an era where cyberattacks are inevitable, possessing a Data Resiliency strategy featuring Immutability and Automation (using tools like Elastio or Commvault) is vital for business survival.\nSome photos from the event Add your photos here Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me change my thinking regarding application design, system modernization, and more effective team collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/4-eventparticipated/4.3-event3/","title":"Event 3","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

List of Speakers Van Hoang Kha - Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder Bach Doan Vuong - Cloud DevOps Engineer, AWS Community Builder Key Highlights Below is a summary of the event content focusing on the listed services, presented in a professional report style without icons as requested.\nAWS TRAINING PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT: AI \u0026amp; MACHINE LEARNING\n1. Overview of Technology Concepts\nTo begin the program, we systematized important foundational concepts in the field of intelligent technology:\nAI (Artificial Intelligence): An overarching concept regarding the creation of intelligent systems. ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI that allows computers to learn from data. DL (Deep Learning): Uses complex neural networks to model patterns in data. GenAI (Generative AI): Focuses on creating new content and data. 2. AWS as a Service Provider\nThe next section introduced AWS as a comprehensive service provider. AWS offers Managed Services that help businesses apply AI quickly without investing heavily in building infrastructure from scratch.\n3. Details of Introduced AWS Services\nThe training focused deeply on specific tools designed to solve real-world business problems:\nAmazon Comprehend (Natural Language Processing Service - NLP) This service was discussed in the most detail, featuring powerful multi-language text processing capabilities:\nSentiment Analysis: Automatically classifies customer reviews and comments based on positive, negative, or neutral nuances. Text Summarization: Condenses content from long documents. Large-scale Information Processing: Supports bulk email processing and classification. Information Security: Capable of identifying, classifying, and protecting sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within text.

My main goal was to update my comprehensive view of these technologies on the AWS platform and learn how to apply them to real-world business problems.\nSpeakers The session featured sharing from experienced experts in the industry, including Mr. Lam Tuan Kiet (Sr DevOps Engineer - FPT Software), Mr. Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi (AI Engineer - Renova Cloud), Mr. Dinh Le Hoang Anh (Cloud Engineer Trainee), and Mr. Van Hoang Kha (Community Builder).\nValuable Knowledge I Harvested:\n1. The Power of Generative AI on Amazon Bedrock This was the part that impressed me the most. Amazon Bedrock acts as a central platform, providing access to leading Foundation Models (FMs) from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, etc. This allows us to fine-tune existing models without having to build a model from scratch.\nI also reinforced my skills in Prompt Engineering, understanding better how to guide the model through various strategies:\nZero-shot: Providing a request directly without examples. Few-shot: Providing a handful of examples for the model to mimic. Chain-of-Thought: Asking the model to explain its reasoning steps for a more logical result. Specifically, the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technique was highlighted as an optimal solution to improve accuracy:\nRetrieval: Pulling real data from the enterprise knowledge base. Augmentation: Adding that data as context for the prompt. Generation: The model answers based on factual information, minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, Amazon Titan Embeddings was introduced as a tool to convert text into vectors, serving semantic search and multilingual RAG workflows.\n2. AWS AI Services Ecosystem Beyond GenAI, I also reviewed AWS\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ready-made\u0026rdquo; AI services (APIs) that help solve specific problems quickly without complex model training:\nImage/Video Analysis (Rekognition). Translation (Translate) and Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech (Transcribe, Polly). Data Extraction (Textract) and Natural Language Processing (Comprehend). Intelligent Search (Kendra) or Anomaly Detection (Lookout). The AMZPhoto face recognition demo visually illustrated how to integrate these services into a real product.\n3. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore – Putting AI Agents into Practice This is a new framework helping to solve the problem of operating AI Agents at scale (production-ready). It supports long-term memory management, identity security, tool integration (like browsers, code interpreters), and most importantly, observability. This makes deploying frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph safer and more effective on the AWS platform.\nPlan for Application at Work Based on what I learned, I plan to apply the following knowledge immediately:\nDeploy RAG \u0026amp; AgentCore: Propose and apply these to upcoming internal projects requiring GenAI features to increase accuracy and automation capabilities. Optimize Development Process: Use available AWS AI Services instead of building from scratch to shorten Time-to-market. Improve Model Performance: Apply advanced Prompt Engineering techniques to optimize output results for current AI tasks. Side Experience Not only did I absorb knowledge, but the event atmosphere was also extremely lively. I was lucky enough to reach the Top 6 in the Kahoot competition; however, I dropped off the leaderboard during the final questions. Nevertheless, it was still an interesting game that helped me reinforce the knowledge from this event.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/4-eventparticipated/4.5-event5/","title":"Event 5","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only; please do not copy it verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nSummary Report: Attending AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 – DevOps on AWS Attendance Objectives Continuing the event series, I attended the second session focusing on DevOps. My goal was to master AWS services supporting DevOps, deepen my understanding of CI/CD pipeline design, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts, as well as how to deploy and monitor containerized applications on the AWS platform.\nSpeakers The session gathered a strong lineup of speakers, including AWS Community Builders and experienced engineers:\nMr. Truong Quang Tinh – Platform Engineer (TymeX) Mr. Bao Huynh, Nguyen Khanh Phuc Thinh, Tran Dai Vi, Huynh Hoang Long, Pham Hoang Quy, Nghiem Le (AWS Community Builders) Mr. Dinh Le Hoang Anh – Cloud Engineer Trainee (First Cloud AI Journey) Valuable Knowledge I Harvested: 1. Building a DevOps Foundation The speakers helped me redefine that DevOps is not a job title but a mindset and habit of working. The core lies in:\nAutomating repetitive tasks. Sharing knowledge across teams. Continuously experimenting and learning. Measuring effectiveness with real data rather than assumptions. I also learned lessons about common pitfalls for beginners: avoid getting stuck in \u0026ldquo;tutorial hell\u0026rdquo; without starting real projects, and focus on personal progress rather than comparing oneself to others.\n2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Practice This section broadened my horizon regarding IaC tools instead of sticking to a single one. The speakers provided a detailed comparison:\nCloudFormation: AWS\u0026rsquo;s native template tool. AWS CDK: For developers who prefer writing infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Terraform: The optimal choice for teams working on multi-cloud platforms. The most important message: Infrastructure built via Code (IaC) is significantly more consistent, maintainable, and secure compared to manual configuration (ClickOps).\n3. Containers and Deployment Models The content ranged from basics (Dockerfile, Image) to advanced AWS services:\nAmazon ECR: Storage and security scanning for images. Amazon ECS \u0026amp; EKS: Two popular container orchestration options. The comparison between ECS (simple, native) and EKS (powerful with Kubernetes) helped me know when to use which. AWS App Runner: A quick deployment solution without worrying about cluster management. 4. Monitoring and Observability A system cannot lack monitoring capabilities. I understood better the roles of:\nAmazon CloudWatch: The center for metrics, logs, and alarms. AWS X-Ray: A tracing tool helping visualize request flows and detect bottlenecks. Core lesson: Observability features must be designed from the very beginning, not added after the system is built.\nPlan for Application at Work Specifically, I plan to apply this knowledge to the team\u0026rsquo;s upcoming AI Chatbot Project:\nEstablish CI/CD Pipeline: Use AWS CodePipeline to automate the entire process from Build, Test, to Deploy. The goal is to ensure every code update is tested and pushed to production smoothly. Implement IaC: Use AWS CDK to define all resources (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, IAM\u0026hellip;). This makes the system easy to reuse for different environments and scale quickly when needed. Applying this process will help the Chatbot project develop faster, minimize human error, and make operations easier.\nEvent Experience The session gave me a practical perspective on how modern businesses implement DevOps on AWS. Beyond theory, the real-world examples from speakers about CloudFormation, Terraform, or how to choose EKS/ECS were truly valuable.\nBeyond professional knowledge, this was also a good occasion for me to network with like-minded friends and learn \u0026ldquo;hard-earned\u0026rdquo; experiences from those who came before me.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/4-eventparticipated/4.6-event6/","title":"Event 6","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

Overview \u0026amp; Speakers The event focused on the most critical pillar within the AWS Well-Architected Framework: Security. The content was designed to equip attendees with knowledge ranging from fundamental to advanced levels regarding identity, monitoring, infrastructure protection, data protection, and incident response processes.\nSpeakers \u0026amp; Experts: The event gathered experts from the AWS Community (AWS Community Builders), AWS Cloud Club Captains from various universities (HCMUTE, SGU, PTIT, HUFLIT), Cloud Engineers from FCJ, and specially featuring Mendel Grabski (Security \u0026amp; DevOps Expert).\nAbout AWS Cloud Club: This is a network connecting students and professionals, helping to develop technical leadership skills, providing hands-on experiences, and offering long-term mentoring opportunities. The participating Cloud Clubs under FCJA include: HCMUTE, SGU, PTIT, and HUFLIT.\n2. Key Technical Highlights A. Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) IAM is defined as the \u0026ldquo;first line of defense.\u0026rdquo; The session emphasized the shift from manual management to automation and strict adherence to key principles:\nLeast Privilege Principle: Grant only the necessary permissions required to perform a task. Root User Protection: Delete access keys immediately after creation. Service Control Policies (SCPs): Use Organization-level policies to set a \u0026ldquo;ceiling\u0026rdquo; (maximum available permissions) for member accounts (Note: SCPs only filter permissions; they do not grant them). Permission Boundaries: Set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to a specific User/Role. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Encouraged the use of FIDO2 (hardware keys/biometrics) over traditional TOTP. Credential Rotation: Use AWS Secrets Manager to automate the rotation process (create -\u0026gt; set -\u0026gt; test -\u0026gt; finish) and integrate with EventBridge to manage schedules, eliminating risks associated with \u0026ldquo;hardcoded credentials.\u0026rdquo; B. Continuous Monitoring \u0026amp; Threat Detection The focus was on building comprehensive visibility and automated response capabilities:\nMulti-Layer Monitoring: Combining CloudTrail (recording API calls, S3/Lambda access) and VPC Flow Logs (network traffic). Event-Driven Security: Using EventBridge as a central event bus to route real-time alerts to Lambda/SNS/SQS or coordinate actions across different accounts (Cross-account routing). Detection-as-Code: Managing detection rules and queries (CloudTrail Lake queries) as code (version control) to ensure consistent deployment across the organization. Deep Dive into Amazon GuardDuty: This is an intelligent threat detection solution that operates continuously based on three main data sources: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs.\nExpanded Coverage: Protection for S3, EKS, RDS (brute-force detection), Lambda (suspicious network activity), and Malware Protection (EBS scanning). Runtime Monitoring: Uses an Agent to monitor deep inside the OS (processes, file access) on EC2/EKS/Fargate. C. Compliance \u0026amp; Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security compliance is no longer a manual check but is integrated into the deployment pipeline:\nApplied Standards: AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, CIS Benchmark, PCI DSS, NIST. Enforcement Mechanism: Using AWS CloudFormation (IaC) to deploy standard configurations, combined with AWS Security Hub to automatically audit resources against defined standards. D. Network \u0026amp; Data Protection Network Security: Clearly distinguishing between Security Groups (Stateful - instance level firewall) and NACLs (Stateless - subnet level firewall). Introduction to AWS Network Firewall for advanced Egress filtering/IPS and integration with Threat Intelligence to automatically block malicious traffic. Data Protection: Encryption: Using KMS with Customer Master Keys (CMK) and Policy conditions to control decryption contexts. Certificates: Using AWS ACM to manage and automatically renew SSL/TLS certificates. Service Security: Enforcing HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for S3 (via Bucket Policy) and Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL rds.force_ssl=1). E. Incident Response (IR) The standard IR process consists of 5 steps: Preparation -\u0026gt; Detection \u0026amp; Analysis -\u0026gt; Containment -\u0026gt; Eradication \u0026amp; Recovery -\u0026gt; Post-Incident Activity.\nPrevention Strategy: Never make S3 buckets public, isolate sensitive services in private subnets, and ensure all infrastructure changes go through IaC with a review process (double-gate). 3. Practical Experience \u0026amp; Q\u0026amp;A The event provided high practical value, specifically aligning with the \u0026ldquo;Automated Incident Response and Forensics\u0026rdquo; project our team is developing.\nDiscussion Point: During our project testing, the team noticed that Amazon GuardDuty has a latency of about 5 minutes to generate a finding after an incident occurs. We asked about solutions to reduce this latency.\nExpert Answer:\nThe Nature of the Service: The GuardDuty latency is an accepted technical characteristic because the system needs time to analyze large datasets to accurately determine threats and avoid false positives. Alternative Solutions: To achieve near real-time detection, the expert suggested integrating 3rd party solutions like OpenClarity (open source) or building custom anomaly detection logic based on CloudTrail events. Networking: After the event, Mr. Mendel Grabski (Ex-Head of Security \u0026amp; DevOps) expressed interest and offered professional support for our project, opening up valuable collaboration and mentoring opportunities.\nSome photos from the event participation [Add your photos here] Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also changed my mindset regarding application design, system modernization, and effective team collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/","title":"Internship Report","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Internship Report ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Customer Background:\nThe DaiVietBlood system is designed to serve the community, including voluntary blood donors, patients in need of emergency blood, and healthcare professionals in Vietnam. The primary customers are blood donors, patient families, and medical staff responsible for managing blood inventory and donation schedules. They require a centralized, reliable platform to optimize the matching process between donors and recipients and improve communication during emergencies. In the context of digital health transformation, DaiVietBlood provides a secure, accessible solution to address localized blood shortages.\nBusiness and Technical Objectives:\nMigrating the DaiVietBlood system from a local/on-premise environment to AWS offers superior advantages:\nBusiness: AWS allows the application to scale flexibly according to the user base, reduces hardware infrastructure operational costs, and ensures consistent performance nationwide. Technical: AWS provides High Availability and medical data security. Adopting a Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, RDS) simplifies backend management, accelerates development, and reduces maintenance costs. The system integrates comprehensive monitoring (CloudWatch) and adheres to strict security standards. Summary of Key Use Cases:\nRole Key Function Short Description Guest Access Public Information View donation guidelines, blood compatibility charts, and educational articles without logging in. Member Register/Login, Profile Management Create accounts, update personal information and blood type. Book Blood Donation Select time slots and locations for donation. Submit Emergency Request Submit urgent blood requests; the system automatically finds suitable donors. Staff Manage Requests \u0026amp; Inventory Approve emergency requests, confirm donation schedules, update blood stock. Administrator (Admin) System Administration Manage user accounts, configure donation slots, view overview reports. Summary of Partner’s Professional Services: The Skyline Team will provide comprehensive digital transformation services, including assessing the current local application, designing a Cloud-native architecture, and executing the migration of the system to an AWS Serverless environment. We commit to delivering a secure, scalable system accompanied by automated CI/CD pipelines and detailed operational documentation.\n1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA Functionality: 100% of core functions (registration, scheduling, emergency requests, administration) operate stably on AWS with no regression errors. Availability: System achieves Uptime ≥ 99.9%, ensuring continuous 24/7 access. Performance: Application response time improves by at least 30% compared to the local version. Emergency request processing time is reduced by 40%. Cost: Infrastructure costs are optimized by at least 20% thanks to the Serverless model and Auto-scaling. User Experience: UAT acceptance rate reaches a minimum of 95% for all user roles. Security: Full compliance with data encryption, access management (IAM), and API security requirements. Operations: CI/CD pipeline is fully automated with deployment time \u0026lt; 10 minutes. Monitoring system covers 100% of critical services. 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS Technical \u0026amp; Architectural Assumptions:\nSource Code: The current Local application (Frontend \u0026amp; Backend) is functionally complete. The project focuses on Refactoring for the Cloud (Serverless), excluding the development of new features. AWS Region: The entire infrastructure is deployed in Singapore (ap-southeast-1) to optimize latency for users in Vietnam. Note: During the testing phase, due to limited VPC configurations and Free Tier/Student resources, latency may fluctuate (estimated ~3.5s/request). Service Limits: The AWS account uses default limits (Soft limits). Increasing limits to reduce latency will be approved by the Customer when necessary. Third-party Integration: The system uses the Gemini API for AI support features. Access Rights: The Skyline Team is granted Admin access (IAM Role) to provision resources. Operational \u0026amp; Financial Assumptions:\nDomain: The Customer owns the domain name (e.g., daivietblood.com) and DNS configuration rights. Cost: The cost estimate is based on an assumption of approximately 50,000 API requests/month. Actual costs depend on usage levels (Pay-as-you-go). 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM The DaiVietBlood system utilizes a Serverless-First architecture on AWS Cloud, prioritizing scalability, security, and operational optimization.\nKey Components:\nNetwork Infrastructure (VPC): Public Subnet: Contains Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway. Private Subnet: Contains AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS to isolate and secure data, preventing direct Internet access. Application \u0026amp; Data: Frontend: Hosted on AWS Amplify, distributed via Amazon CloudFront (CDN), and assets stored on S3. Authentication: Amazon Cognito manages identity and issues JWT tokens. API \u0026amp; Compute: Amazon API Gateway receives requests and routes them to AWS Lambda for business logic processing. Database: Amazon RDS stores structured data, located in the Private Subnet. DevOps \u0026amp; Monitoring: CI/CD: Uses AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process. Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch centrally collects logs and metrics. 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN The technical implementation process follows the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) methodology:\nInfrastructure Automation: Use AWS CloudFormation to provision VPC, Lambda, RDS, and API Gateway, ensuring consistency across environments (Dev/Staging/Prod). Application Development: Refactor backend into modular Lambda functions (NodeJS/Python). Environment variables and sensitive information (DB credentials) are securely encrypted. CI/CD Process: Source (GitHub) -\u0026gt; Build (CodeBuild) -\u0026gt; Deploy (CloudFormation/CodeDeploy). Includes a Manual Approval step before deploying to the Production environment. Testing Strategy: Unit Tests for Lambda, Integration Tests for API, and Load Tests to ensure capacity. 2.3 PROJECT PLAN The project applies the Agile Scrum model over 8 weeks (4 Sprints):\nSprint 1 (Foundation): Set up AWS Account, VPC, RDS.

This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/1-worklog/1.8-week8/","title":"Week 8 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 8 Goals: Consolidate knowledge acquired from previous weeks.

The lack of high-funnel interactions like \u0026ldquo;View\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Click\u0026rdquo; makes it difficult for the model to capture latent user preferences. Consequence: The model\u0026rsquo;s evaluation metrics after training are relatively low, leading to significant skepticism regarding the accuracy and practical effectiveness of the recommendations. Validation Blockers:\nSince the Website Frontend is not yet complete, I cannot perform real-world validation (visual checks) to see if the recommendations make sense intuitively. Currently, I rely solely on abstract metrics. Data Schema Evolution:\nThe addition of new data fields during development caused friction in the data processing pipeline. Every schema change required re-cleaning the data, re-mapping the schema, and retraining the model from scratch, which was time-consuming.
